## Introduction to V2X

V2X enables vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, roadside infrastructure, pedestrians etc. Main objectives are traffic efficiency, safety, and reducing environmental impact.

Two main technologies:

- DSRC - Dedicated Short Range Communications 
- C-V2X - Cellular V2X

## DSRC 

- Based on 802.11p 
- Operates in 5.9GHz band
- Supports V2V and V2I communication
- Provides low latency <50ms

## C-V2X

- Based on LTE technology
- Supports V2N, V2V, V2I, V2P modes
- Provides improved range, latency, reliability over DSRC
- Leverages LTE-Direct with enhancements 

## LTE V2X Evolution 

- Introduced in LTE Release 12
- Enhancements in Release 14 for high speed/density
- Further evolution in 5G NR V2X

## Interfaces and Channels

- PC5 - Direct V2V interface
- Uu - Interface between UE and cellular network
- Channels like PSCCH, PSSCH for control and shared data

## Deployment and Applications

- Safety use cases - collision avoidance, hazard warning etc.
- Traffic efficiency - managing road congestion
- Increasingly autonomous driving capabilities
